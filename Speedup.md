# Tips to speedup CPE Blocks
Think your project goes slow? There're many tips to speed it up.

## Move your project to CPE Blocks
If you have your project on the outdated BYOB-based MLS Blocks, its about time to move your project to the Snap!-based CPE Blocks. It will facilitate faster speeds and fewer slowdowns.

Note that you must rebuild your project from scratch instead of porting it your MLS Blocks-powered project to Snap! as much of the code is incompatible. This can be tedius for large projects but this is the only way to make your old project CPE Blocks-powered. Note that many blocks have been merged into one block or renamed.

## Optimizing code
Various releases (Such as the forthcoming 10.0 Release of CPE) can optimize code, speeding up the various existing CPE Blocks. Newer releases also contain more blocks compared to the past ones.

## Enable Live Coding
If snap! is open, Shift-Click on the gear menu and enable the **Live Coding Support** this will be make block editor changes happen instantly if you decide to edit them and this will also speed-up various block while doing intensive things.

## Use Hyperblocks
Enabling Hyperblocks (Enabled by default) will make things more enjoyable if you plan to work with list of lists as it allows to use lists in numerical inputs. It will also speed-up a minor amount of CPE blocks as well as adding new features to many of the existing CPE Blocks.
