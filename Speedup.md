# Tips to speedup your workflow
Back on the days when MLS Blocks was started in late-2014 and finished in early-September 2020, you had the interface of Scratch 1.4 with BYOB Scratch Mod (With two added control blocks) and the project that gave the blocks. Unfortunately, we couldn't make too many optimizations to this project and thus several blocks and projects weren't suitable with the MLS Blocks ecosystem it existed. Below there're ways to speed up projects that originated from the MLS Blocks or the newer, more-minded CPE Blocks:

## Move your project to CPE Blocks
If you have your project on the outdated BYOB-based MLS Blocks, its about time to move your project to the Snap!-based CPE Blocks. It will facilitate faster speeds and up to fewer or no slowdowns on many block combinations

Note that you must rebuild your project from scratch instead of porting it your MLS Blocks-powered project to Snap! as much of the code is incompatible. This can be tedius for large projects but this is the only way to make your old project CPE Blocks-powered. Note that many blocks have been merged into one block or renamed.

## Optimizing code
Various releases (Such as the forthcoming 10.0 Release of CPE) can optimize code, speeding up the various existing CPE Blocks. Newer releases also contain more blocks compared to the past ones.

## Enable Live Coding
If snap! is open, Shift-Click on the gear menu and enable the **Live Coding Support**, this will be make block editor changes happen instantly if you decide to edit them and will also speed-up various block while doing intensive things.

## Use Hyperblocks
Enabling Hyperblocks (Enabled by default) will make things more enjoyable if you plan to work with list of lists as it allows to use lists in numerical inputs. It will also speed-up a minor amount of CPE blocks as well as adding new features to many of the existing CPE Blocks.
