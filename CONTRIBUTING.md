# Suggesting new blocks
- You can send us an issue on this repo and say to us which block you wanted to have in CPE
- Blocks will be reviewed, if those needed were made already
- No blocks that are clones of existing blocks, with super tiny exceptions
- Blocks may be edited as well once implemented
- Your block must be in English Language. However, we will ignore the Greek translation that you gave (If you do it so) as the greek translation is always done on my own. Any other language translations will be approved in some cases
# Releasing New Versions
CPE is releasing new versions periodically. Version syntax is `major.minor.breaking.patch`

Major Versions (i.e x.0.0) can give as many blocks as needed (Up to 100 for obvious reaons)

Minor Versions (i.e x.x.0) can give up to 15 blocks in a single release

Breaking Versions (i.e x.x.x) can give either no blocks, a single block, two blocks unrelated to each other and up to three blocks all related to each other

Patch Versions (i.e. x.x.x.x) can only give critical bug fixes. It can also give a single block under special circumstances

# Other Rules
- No spamming
- No vandalism
- No advertising
- If the developer asks you to stop, you must.
